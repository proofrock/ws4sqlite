### Concurrency (or lack thereof)

All transactions are submitted to the database on one connection, in non-concurrent fashion, i.e. at a given time at most
one transaction can be active. A per-connection mutex takes care of this, as suggested by the go/sqlite lib we use 
(see [here](https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite/-/issues/133) and also issue #22).

If two databases are opened on the same file (see next point) there could be concurrent accesses, so take care to set 
WAL etc. accordingly. Also, it's your duty to check and retry on SQL_BUSY errors.

### Serve two instances of the same database file

It can be done, and it makes perfect sense (e.g. to expose a read only instance without authentication, and a read-write
one with auth). Just specify the same file in two db configurations, and use them normally.

See FAQ #5 at the [SQLite's site](https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html), and the test case `TestTwoServesOneDb()` in the 
code. Again, it's your duty to check and retry on possible SQL_BUSY errors.
