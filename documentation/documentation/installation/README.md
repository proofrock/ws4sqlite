# ðŸ”§ Installation

Installation consists of a single executable file. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sql/releases) page on GitHub, and download the compressed file relevant for your OS and architecture; then extract it.

If there are no files for your OS/arch, look into [building it yourself](../../building-and-testing.md).

Either way, you'll have a single binary (albeit a little bulky). Take it to the [running](../running.md) stage.
