# ðŸŒ± ws4sqlite

> _A bit of status report. The `ws4sql` [fork](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite/tree/fork/ws4sql) (to integrate `duckdb` alongside `sqlite`) is back on track, hopefully to be released "as soon as" the documentation is in good shape._

**`ws4sqlite`** is a server application that, applied to one or more sqlite files, allows to perform SQL queries and statements on them via REST (or better, JSON over HTTP).

Possible use cases are the ones where remote access to a sqlite db is useful/needed, for example a data layer for a remote application, possibly serverless or even called from a web page (*after security considerations* of course).

Client libraries are available, that will abstract the "raw" JSON-based communication. See 
[here](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite-client-jvm) for Java/JVM, [here](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite-client-go) for Go(lang); others will follow.

As a quick example, after launching 

```bash
ws4sqlite --db mydatabase.db
```

It's possible to make a POST call to `http://localhost:12321/mydatabase`, e.g. with the following body:

```json5
// Set Content-type: application/json
{
    "resultFormat": "map", // "map" or "list"; if omitted, "map"
    "transaction": [
        {
            "statement": "INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE (ID, VAL, VAL2) VALUES (:id, :val, :val2)",
            "values": { "id": 1, "val": "hello", "val2": null }
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT * FROM TEST_TABLE"
        }
    ]
}
```

Obtaining an answer of

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "success": true,
            "rowsUpdated": 1
        },
        {
            "success": true,
            "resultSet": [
                { "ID": 1, "VAL": "hello", "VAL2": null }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

# Features

[Docs](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/), a [Tutorial](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/tutorial), a [Discord](https://discord.gg/nBCcq2VQPu).

- Aligned to [**SQLite 3.50.3**](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_50_3.html);
- A [**single executable file**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/installation) (written in Go);
- HTTP/JSON access, with [**client libraries**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/client-libraries) for convenience;
- Directly call `ws4sqlite` on a database (as above), many options available using a YAML companion file;
- [**In-memory DBs**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/configuration-file#path)  are supported;
- Serving of [**multiple databases**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/configuration-file) in the same server instance;
- [**Batching**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/requests#batch-parameter-values-for-a-statement) of multiple value sets for a single statement;
- [**Parameters**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/requests#parameter-values-for-the-query-statement) may be passed to statements positionally (lists) or by name (maps);
- [**Results**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/responses#list-format-for-resultsets) of queries may be returned as key-value maps, or as values lists;
- All queries of a call are executed in a [**transaction**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/requests);
- For each query/statement, specify if a failure should rollback the whole transaction, or the failure is [**limited**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/errors#managed-errors) to that query;
- "[**Stored Statements**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/stored-statements)": define SQL in the server, and call it from the client;
- [**CORS**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/configuration-file#corsorigin) mode, configurable per-db;
- [**Scheduled tasks**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/sched_tasks), cron-like and/or at startup, also configurable per-db;
- Scheduled tasks can be: backup (with rotation), vacuum and/or a set of SQL statements;
- Provide [**initialization statements**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/configuration-file#initstatements) to execute when a DB is created;
- [**WAL**](https://sqlite.org/wal.html) mode enabled by default, can be [disabled](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/configuration-file#disablewalmode);
- [**Quite fast**](features/performances.md)!
- [**Embedded web server**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/web-server) to directly serve web pages that can access ws4sqlite without CORS;
- Compact codebase;
- Comprehensive test suite (`make test`);
- 11 os's/arch's directly supported;
- [**Docker images**](https://germ.gitbook.io/ws4sqlite/documentation/installation/docker), for amd64, arm and arm64.

# Security Features

* [**Authentication**](documentation/security.md#authentication) can be configured
  * on the client, either using HTTP Basic Authentication or specifying the credentials in the request;
  * on the server, either by specifying credentials (also with hashed passwords) or providing a query to look them up in the db itself;
  * customizable `Not Authorized` error code (if 401 is not optimal)
* A database can be opened in [**read-only mode**](documentation/security.md#read-only-databases) (only queries will be allowed);
* It's possible to enforce using [**only stored statements**](documentation/security.md#stored-statements-to-prevent-sql-injection), to avoid some forms of SQL injection and receiving SQL from the client altogether;
* [**CORS Allowed Origin**](documentation/security.md#cors-allowed-origin) can be configured and enforced;
* It's possible to [**bind**](documentation/security.md#binding-to-a-network-interface) to a network interface, to limit access.

# Design Choices

Some design choices:

* Very thin layer over SQLite. Errors and type translation, for example, are those provided by the SQLite driver;
* Doesn't include HTTPS, as this can be done easily (and much more securely) with a [reverse proxy](documentation/security.md#use-a-reverse-proxy-if-going-on-the-internet);
* Doesn't support SQLite extensions, to improve portability.
